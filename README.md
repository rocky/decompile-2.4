This preserves the early code of a Python decompiler for Python versions 1.5 to 2.4.

I have been able to install this using pyenv using Python 2.3.7 using `python ./setup.py install`

Since this is the basis for a number of subsequent decompilers, I find it interesting to see how ideas evolved.

See [HISTORY.md](https://github.com/rocky/decompile-2.4/blob/master/HISTORY.md) for my (rocky) reading on the evolution to this point.
