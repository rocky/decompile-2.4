decompyle (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Dan Pascu <dan@windowmaker.org> that fixes problems
    with optimised jumps in Python >= 2.3.  In the previous release
    (decompyle 2.3), these problems meant that some files were incorrectly
    decompiled and others could not be decompiled at all.  With this new
    patch, thorough testing over the standard python libraries suggests that
    decompyle 2.3.1 can handle everything that decompyle 2.2beta1 could.
